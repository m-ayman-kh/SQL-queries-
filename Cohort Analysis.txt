_________________

1-) Build one SQL query to create a cohort of Signup to First Order and show the result. The objective of this cohort is to see, out of the users that signed up in Week N, how many did their first order in Week N+1, N+2, N+3... 
As an input, you have 2 tables : one with user_id, signup_timestamp AND a second one with user_id, order_timestamp. 


SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT signup.user_id) AS weeks_cohort, TIMESTAMPDIFF(WEEK, signup_timestamp, order_timestamp) AS weeks_diff,
	FROM signup 
	JOIN signup.user_id = orders.user_id
	GROUP BY “weeks_diff”
	ORDER BY “weeks_cohort” DESC;
